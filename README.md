# finnish_translations
In this repository I present finnish Donald Duck (Aku Ankka) pocket comic books (taskukirja), where I translate the finnish text in order to learn the Finnish language.

#### Note from me (OL)
<em>
I have completed the full Duolingo course in Finnish.
The next step is now to start to read comic books (Aku Ankka is then probably my favorite).
After that the goal is to start reading "proper" finnish literature.
